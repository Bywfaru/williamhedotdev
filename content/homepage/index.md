      ## Pleased to meet you!


      I'm a ${age}-year old full-stack web developer with a burning passion for
      web design and development. I'm a [British Columbia Institute of
      Technology](https://www.bcit.ca/) (BCIT) graduate, where I completed my
      Computer Systems Technology - Web and Mobile Development diploma. I am
      currently working towards earning my Bachelor of Science in Applied
      Computer Science with a specialty in Wireless and Mobile Applications
      Development, also at BCIT.


      Aside from web development, I would love to pursue game design and
      development. I have always dreamed about telling moving tales through
      exciting gameplay accompanied by breathtaking art.


      I built this portfolio using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), powered by
      [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/).
